## How to use this thing
1. mcast <#number of messages> <#proc index> <#number of processes>

## Notes
1. I only tested `n` machines with `x` messages and `m` machines with 0 messages, which is a success. I haven't tested machines with different number of messages to send which does not equal to 0 (and I don't think we have to).

## Report Summary
1. The clock starts ticking after all processes joined.
2. All processes seem to get ~16.5s to transfer 100k * 1219 bytes to everyone else.
3. All messages are delivered in agreed order.
